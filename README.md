## 🚀 Key Technical Features

### 📝 Content Architecture
```typescript
// Example: Multilingual blog structure
src/content/blog/
├── post-title.md          // English
└── pt/post-title.pt.md    // Portuguese
```

### 🎨 Design System Implementation

## 🏁 Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hugomn/hugo.im.git your-project
cd your-project
npm install
```

### 2. Configuration
```typescript
// src/config.ts
export const SITE: Site = {
  website: "https://your-domain.com/",
  author: "Your Name",
  title: "Your Site Title",
  desc: "Your site description",
};
```

### 3. Content Structure
- Replace `src/pages/about.md` with your content
- Update blog posts in `src/content/blog/`
- Add images to `public/assets/`
- Customize favicon and branding assets

### 4. Styling & Branding
```bash
# Generate favicon set
python3 scripts/generate_favicon.py your-image.jpg

# Update styling
# Edit src/styles/ for custom CSS
# Modify Tailwind config for design tokens
```

## 📱 Development & Deployment

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `npm install` | Install all dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Start development server at `localhost:4321` |
| `npm run build` | Build optimized production site |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint with TypeScript support |
| `npm run format` | Format codebase with Prettier |

## 🎨 Architecture Patterns

### Component Structure
```
