I have a special passion for sharing content, meeting new people, and contributing to the communities I am a part of. So I take great pleasure in speaking at conferences, meet-ups, internal events, or any other opportunity. If you would like me to speak at your event, please don't hesitate to get in touch. 👋🏻

### Avoiding burnout as a software engineer 🇺🇸

A recent Gallup study found that about 2/3 of full-time workers experience burnout on the job. In this talk I clarify what is burnout and the myths around it, and try to give clear action points on how to avoid it as a software engineer and as a manager.

### How to develop reusable components with Babel and RollupJS 🇺🇸

In this talk I try to show, with a very simple example, the context of creating the concept of modules in JavaScript. I also did a live-coding session, showing how to create and publish reusable components. Full video at the end of the post.
