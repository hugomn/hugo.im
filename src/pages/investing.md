I'm an angel investor writing small checks to early-stage inspiring founders.

My motto: **I write checks to founders that I'd love to work together but can't due to my excitement with Complyance.**

## Investment Philosophy

After two decades building products and leading engineering teams, I've learned that exceptional founders share certain qualities: they see problems others miss, they build solutions with genuine user empathy, and they execute with both technical depth and product intuition.

I invest in founders who combine deep domain expertise with the ability to turn complex technical challenges into elegant solutions that users actually love. These are the people I'd want as teammates if I weren't so committed to what we're building at Complyance.

## Focus Areas

My investments center on areas where I can provide genuine value beyond capital:

- **Fintech**: Systems that handle complex financial workflows with exceptional user experience
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Practical applications of AI that enhance human capabilities rather than replace them
- **B2B SaaS**: Enterprise tools that make complex professional work more intuitive and efficient

## Portfolio

### MoMo Coffee (2024)

A technology-enabled coffee chain that's reimagining how coffee shops operate. What excited me about MoMo wasn't just their approach to coffee, but how they're using technology to create better experiences for both customers and baristas. The founders combine deep hospitality experience with thoughtful technology implementation.

### Stealth Project Management Tool (2024)

An early-stage company building project management software for technical teams. I can't share details yet, but what drew me in was the founders' unique perspective on how engineering teams actually work versus how current tools assume they work.

## 2025 Plans

This year, I'm planning to help 10 founders through small but meaningful investments. I'm particularly interested in meeting founders who are:

- Building in spaces where technology can create step-function improvements in how people work
- Solving problems they've personally experienced as practitioners in their domain
- Combining technical innovation with exceptional product thinking

## Let's Connect

If you're building something in fintech, AI, or B2B SaaS and think we might be a good fit, I'd love to learn about what you're working on.

The best way to reach me is through [email](/contact) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/hugomn). I try to respond to every founder who reaches out.
