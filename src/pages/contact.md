I spend most of my time building agent infrastructure and solving the gnarly problems of making autonomous systems work safely in production. But that's just one of the things I'm passionate about.

I'm also interested in conversations about:

- **Building innovative products and startups** - I love early-stage chaos and finding product-market fit
- **Creating great UI/UX** - Design and user experience are at the core of everything I build
- **Investing in early-stage founders** - Helping technical founders navigate growth and scale
- **Hard technical problems** - Especially around infrastructure, systems architecture, and production challenges

I'm not looking for a new role. I'm deeply engaged in what I'm building right now. But I'm always open to interesting conversations with founders tackling hard problems, early-stage companies looking for product/technical guidance, or people working on things that could genuinely change how we build software.

If you're building something ambitious, dealing with a complex problem, or think we should talk, reach out.
