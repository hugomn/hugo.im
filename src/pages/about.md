Hello, I'm Hugo.

## I Build Products That Matter

With two decades of experience at the intersection of engineering, product, and design, I specialize in turning complex technical challenges into elegant solutions that users actually love. Currently leading the development of [Complyance's](https://www.complyance.com) AI-driven GRC platform, where we're reimagining enterprise compliance through intelligent automation and thoughtful user experience.

My background is unusual for a CPTO: I write code, shape product strategy, and design user interfaces. I've spent years as a hands-on engineer building scalable systems, led product teams through 0→1 launches, and crafted user experiences from wireframes to final implementation. I think in design systems and technical architectures simultaneously. This rare three-way intersection lets me bridge engineering constraints, product requirements, and user needs in ways that create products that are both technically excellent and genuinely useful.

I'm particularly drawn to complex problem domains where thoughtful product strategy, solid engineering, and careful design can create step-function improvements in how people work.

## What I'm Working On

At Complyance, I'm leading the development of what will become the most sophisticated GRC platform in the market. We're building AI systems that understand compliance contexts, automate complex regulatory workflows, and surface insights that actually help teams make better decisions. It's the kind of product that requires deep technical innovation, thoughtful product strategy, and exceptional user experience working together.

The challenge is fascinating: how do you build software that can understand nuanced regulatory requirements, learn from compliance experts, and present complex information in ways that help people make confident decisions? It requires everything I love about product development.

## My Approach

Great products come from understanding problems deeply before building solutions. My approach combines:

- **User empathy first**: Technology should solve real problems elegantly
- **Product thinking**: Building what matters most, in the right sequence
- **Technical depth**: Architecture decisions that scale with business growth
- **Design craft**: Interfaces that feel intuitive even for complex workflows
- **Team excellence**: Creating environments where engineering, product, and design collaborate seamlessly

## Background

Twenty years of building products across fintech, health tech, and enterprise SaaS. I've architected systems that handle millions of transactions, led engineering teams through rapid scale, guided product strategy from initial concept to market success, and designed user experiences that make complex workflows feel simple.

What excites me most is the rare opportunity to influence all three dimensions: building technically robust systems, shaping product direction based on deep user understanding, and crafting interfaces that people actually enjoy using.

## Current Focus

These days, I'm fascinated by how AI can amplify human capabilities without replacing human judgment. At Complyance, we're building agentic AI systems that understand regulatory context, learn from expert input, and help compliance teams work at a higher level of abstraction. My recent experience shipping AI-driven features has shown me how thoughtful automation, combined with careful product strategy and intuitive design, can transform complex professional workflows.

We're at an inflection point where AI can finally understand context well enough to be genuinely helpful rather than just impressive. The challenge is building systems that enhance human expertise rather than replacing it, and that requires getting the product, engineering, and user experience all working together seamlessly.

It's early days, but I believe we're seeing the beginning of a fundamental shift in how software can understand and assist with professional work.
